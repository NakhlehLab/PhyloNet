/**
 * Created by hunter on 9/18/18.
 *
 * Intention: compare NCM search with ML search using only topology moves.
 *  or compare how many topologies are searched my ML using standard settings.
 *  or check whether NCM is equivalent to MP (MDC) in the tree -> network setting.
 *  And check how NCM performs on larger networks (more than 6 taxa, more complicated, more reticulations)
