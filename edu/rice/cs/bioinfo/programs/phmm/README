README FILE FOR LUAY'S JAHMM

/**
* Luay's JaHmm implemented by Jingxuan Dai and Kathy Truong
*/

******************
File Formats
******************

-> Basic Info File
		This is a .txt file that should contain general information about your 
		sequence files. 

		name format: filename.txt

		Format:
		Line 1) NumberOfSequences (this should be the same number of species)
		Line 2) Legal Alphabet symbols each separated by a space
		Line 3) Species or Taxa each separated by a space (note: this should appear
		in the same order as they are in the sequence files)

		Example:
		3\n
		A C T G\n
		Human Chimp Gorilla\n


-> Tree File
		This .tree file contains all the possible trees or states needed for the 
		Hmm.

		name format: treefilename.tree

		Format of trees should be in NEWICK format
		The File itself is in NEXUS format.
		
		Format:
		line 1) #NEXUS
		line 2) begin trees;
		line 3) tree nameOfTree1 = Tree in newick format
		line 4) tree nameOfTree2 = Tree in newick format
		line 5) tree nameOfTree3 = Tree in newick format
				.
				.
				.
				.
		line *) end;

		Example:
		#NEXUS
		begin trees;
		tree one = (human:10,(chimp:20, gorilla:5):2);
		tree two  = (chimp:10,(human:20, gorilla:5):2);
		tree three = (gorilla:10,(human:20, chimp:5):2);
		end;

		Important NOTES: The order of the trees will be used as a mapping to 
						states in the JAHMM implementation. ie. the first tree
						will correspond to State 0 in HMM.


-> Matrix File
		This .matrix file will contain the state (trees) transition
		probabilities. Once again, the order of the trees given in the .tree 
		file will be used as the mapping and indexing of the matrix.
		ie. matrix[0][1] will be the transition from tree 1 to tree 2.

		Example for a model with 3 trees (3 states):
		.2 .3 .5
		.3 .5 .3
		.5 .2 .2

		Note: sum of probabilities must add up to 1 in each row and in each 
				column


-> Sequence File
		This .seq file will contain all the observations sequence of the given
		genomes.

		Format:
		line 1) LengthOfSequence
		line 2) Type1 Sequence
		line 3) Type2 Sequence
		line 4) Type3 Sequence
				.
				.
				.

		Example:
		5\n
		human ACTGA\n
		gorilla TATAG\n
		chimp CCCTG\n

		Important notes: order of taxa sequence here MUST MATCH the order given
						in the basic info file.
		****A Newline character is important to terminate every sequence line
		
--> Allele Species Mapping File
		This is file that will contain the alleles to species mapping
		
		Format:
		line 1) number of mappings
		line 2) Allele1 Species1
		line 3) Allele2 Species2
				.
				.
				.
		
		Example:
		3\n
		kathy human\n
		willy chimp\n
		kingkong gorilla\n


*********************************************************************
Compilation Requirements and Instructions on how to Use Luay's JAHMM
*********************************************************************
Need to have at hand:
	1. a basic info file
	2. a trees file
	3. a state transition probability matrix
	4. initial state probabilities

Compile the project with the included junit3.8.jar in the build path

Run runHmm.java file.
Follow the instructions and provide appropriate inputs
